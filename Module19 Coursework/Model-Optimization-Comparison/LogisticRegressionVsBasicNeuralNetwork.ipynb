    "# A logistic regression model is a classification algorithm that can analyze continuous and categorical variables. Using a combination of input variables, logistic regression predicts the probability of the input data belonging to one of two groups. If the probability is above a predetermined cutoff, the sample is assigned to the first group, otherwise it is assigned to the second. For example, using an applicant's personal information (such as age and income), logistic regression could be used by a bank to determine if a person does or does not qualify for a credit card.\n",

This sigmoid curve is the exact same curve used in the sigmoid activation function of a neural network. In fact, a basic neural network using the sigmoid activation function is effectively a logistic regression model:\n",

    "# To demonstrate how similar the logistic regression and basic neural network models are in terms of performance, we'll build and evaluate both models using the same training/testing dataset. First, we'll start by downloading this diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv)Links to an external site. and placing it in a folder with a new Jupyter Notebook. Next, we'll make a new Jupyter Notebook and name it \"LogisticRegression_NeuralNet\" (or something similar) to help us easily locate the comparison example at another time. Once we have created our notebook and placed the dataset into the corresponding folder, we'll start by importing our libraries and reading in the dataset.

    "# Beyond the performance of both models, there are a few other factors to consider when selecting a model for your data. First, neural networks are prone to overfitting and can be more difficult to train than a straightforward logistic regression model. Therefore, if you are trying to build a classifier with limited data points (typically fewer than a thousand data points), or if your dataset has only a few features, neural networks may be overcomplicated. Additionally, logistic regression models are easier to dissect and interpret than their neural network counterparts, which tends to put more traditional data scientists and non-data experts at ease. In contrast, neural networks (and especially deep neural networks) thrive in large datasets. Datasets with thousands of data points, or datasets with complex features, may overwhelm the logistic regression model, while a deep learning model can evaluate every interaction within and across neurons. Therefore, the decision between using a logistic regression model and basic neural network model is nuanced and, in most cases, a matter of preference for the data scientist."
