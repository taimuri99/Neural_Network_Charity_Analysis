    "# Neural networks (also known as artificial neural networks, or ANN) are a set of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. They are an advanced form of machine learning that recognizes patterns and features in input data and provides a clear quantitative output. In its simplest form, a neural network contains layers of neurons, which perform individual computations. These computations are connected and weighed against one another until the neurons reach the final layer, which returns a numerical result, or an encoded categorical result.\n",

    "# A deep neural network includes input and output layers. In this example, the layers process an image of an animal to determine whether it is a cat or dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Neural networks are particularly useful in data science because they serve multiple purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# One way to use a neural network model is to create a classification algorithm that determines if an input belongs in one category versus another. Alternatively neural network models can behave like a regression model, where a dependent output variable can be predicted from independent input variables. Therefore, neural network models can be an alternative to many of the models we have learned throughout the course, such as random forest, logistic regression, or multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# There are a number of advantages to using a neural network instead of a traditional statistical or machine learning model. For instance, neural networks are effective at detecting complex, nonlinear relationships. Additionally, neural networks have greater tolerance for messy data and can learn to ignore noisy characteristics in data. The two biggest disadvantages to using a neural network model are that the layers of neurons are often too complex to dissect and understand (creating a black box problem), and neural networks are prone to overfitting (characterizing the training data so well that it does not generalize to test data effectively). However, both of the disadvantages can be mitigated and accounted for.\n",

    "# Overfitting occurs when a model gives undue importance to patterns within a particular dataset that are not found in other, similar datasets.\n",

    "# Neural networks have many practical uses across multiple industries. In the finance industry, neural networks are used to detect fraud as well as trends in the stock market. Retailers like Amazon and Apple are using neural networks to classify their consumers to provide targeted marketing as well as behavior training for robotic control systems. Due to the ease of implementation, neural networks also can be used by small businesses and for personal use to make more cost-effective decisions on investing and purchasing business materials. Neural networks are scalable and effective—it is no wonder why they are so popular."

Beks sends Andy a quick Slack message to let him know the research phase of the project is well under way. Her next step will be to dig into the math a bit: What exactly goes into a neural network? To explore this, she'll start with the perceptron model.\n",
    "# Although artificial neural networks have become popular in recent years, the original design for computational neurons (and, subsequently, the neural network) dates as far back as the late 1950s, when Frank Rosenblatt, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, created the perceptron, a machine for training the first neural network. The perceptron model is a single neural network unit, and it mimics a biological neuron by receiving input data, weighing the information, and producing a clear output.\n",

In other words, the perceptron algorithm works to classify two groups that can be separated using a linear equation (also known as linearly separable). For example, in the image below, we have a purple group and blue group in both figures. In the left figure, we can draw a line down the middle of the figure to separate the groups entirely. While in the right figure, there is no single (straight) line that can be drawn to separate the two groups entirely. Therefore, the left image is considered linearly separable while the right is not:\n",

    "# The 2D graph shows XY data points: four orange crosses and four green\n",
    "# circles.\n",
    "\n",

    "# ⍵0 + 𝜒1⍵1 + 𝜒2⍵2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where ⍵0 is the bias term, and 𝜒1⍵1 and 𝜒2⍵2 are the weighted x and y values for each data point. If the net sum of the data point is greater than zero, it classifies the data point as a purple square, otherwise the data point is classified as a blue circle.\n",

    "# In this image, the perceptron's linear classifier is represented with the dashed line. According to the perceptron model, values above the dashed line would be considered to be purple squares, and values below the dashed line would be considered to be blue circles. Although the perceptron model correctly classified all of the purple square data points, it misclassified one of the blue circle data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The same 2D graph highlights a single misclassified data\n",
    "# point.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The next step in the perceptron algorithm is to check each data point and determine if we need to update the weight coefficients to better classify all data points. When the perceptron model evaluates all of the input data, the correctly classified data points will not change the weight coefficients; however, the incorrectly classified data points will adjust the weight coefficients to move toward the data point.\n",
    "\n",

    "# The perceptron model training performs a set number of iterations, determined by the designer before training.\n",
    "# The perceptron model is stopped or encounters an error during training.\n",
    "# At first glance, the perceptron model is very similar to other classification and regression models; however, the power of the perceptron model comes from its ability to handle multidimensional data and interactivity with other perceptron models. As more multidimensional perceptrons are meshed together and layered, a new, more powerful classification and regression algorithm emerges—the neural network."
